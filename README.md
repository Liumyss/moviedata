# Overview

The datatset that I used for this project is accessible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows).

In this project, I analaze the data from a list of different movies rated in IMDB. My goals was to be able 
to answer some questions to help us understand what makes a movie having more revenue or more votes in IMDB.

My purpose is to use Python and to cover a list of different questions to understand the data that I analyze.
Even though this dataset is a bit short and do not have all the movies to make better assumptions about what 
makes a movie better, I was able to get enough answers to have a first overview throught the IMDB movie dataset.
